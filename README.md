# Project Cheddar Client

This is the client for my work-in-progress game, currently going by "Project Cheddar" until I've decided on a real name.

The client is built in Unity, the server is just a dotnet console application.

## Networking

Much of the net-code was based off of Tom Weiland's YouTube tutorials.
